# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection App  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Rice Leaf Disease Detection App** uses deep learning to analyze images of rice leaves and predict whether they are affected by a disease or healthy. It can classify:  
- **Early Blight**  
- **Late Blight**  
- **Brown Spot**  
- **Healthy Leaf**  

This project is trained on the **PlantVillage Dataset** and deployed as a web service using **FastAPI** for backend API interactions.
